Started -- Your First Hour with GitHub Agents</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You're about to do something pretty cool.</strong></p>
<p>By the end of this guide, you'll have an AI assistant inside your
code editor that talks to GitHub for you -- finding your issues,
reviewing code, tracking your team's progress, and saving you hours of
tab-switching every week.</p>
<p>No prior GitHub expertise needed. We'll walk through everything
together.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before We Begin</h2>
<p>Let's make sure you have what you need. Don't worry if some of these
terms are unfamiliar -- we'll explain each one as we go.</p>
<h3 id="what-you-need">What You Need</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>VS Code</strong> -- a free code editor from Microsoft. If
you're reading this file in VS Code right now, you're already set. If
not, grab it from <a
href="https://code.visualstudio.com">code.visualstudio.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A GitHub account</strong> -- GitHub is where developers
store code, track bugs, and collaborate. If you don't have an account
yet, go to <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and sign up. It's
free.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> -- this is an AI coding assistant
that runs inside VS Code. It has a chat window where you can type
questions and commands. You'll need a Copilot subscription (there's a
free tier for individual use).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That's the full list. No command-line tools, no API keys, no complex
configuration.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-1-install-the-extensions">Step 1: Install the
Extensions</h2>
<p>If you already have GitHub Copilot working in VS Code, skip to <a
href="#step-2-sign-in-to-github">Step 2</a>.</p>
<p>Open VS Code and let's install two extensions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Open the Extensions panel</strong> -- click the square
icon on the left sidebar, or press <code>Ctrl+Shift+X</code> (on Mac:
<code>Cmd+Shift+X</code>). A search bar appears at the top.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Search for "GitHub Copilot"</strong> -- type it in the
search bar. You'll see two extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> -- install this one first. Click the
blue "Install" button.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Copilot Chat</strong> -- install this one too. This
gives you the chat window where you'll talk to the agents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Wait for them to finish installing.</strong> You'll see a
small spinning icon while they download. When it stops, you're
good.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What just happened?</strong> You added two tools to VS Code.
"Copilot" helps you write code. "Copilot Chat" gives you a conversation
window where you can ask questions -- and where our agents live.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-2-sign-in-to-github">Step 2: Sign In to GitHub</h2>
<p>The agents need to talk to GitHub on your behalf -- to read your
issues, check your pull requests, and so on. For that, VS Code needs to
know who you are on GitHub.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Open the Command Palette</strong> -- press
<code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> (on Mac: <code>Cmd+Shift+P</code>). A text box
drops down from the top of VS Code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type "GitHub: Sign In"</strong> -- as you type, you'll see
it appear in the list. Click on it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A browser window opens</strong> -- GitHub asks you to
authorize VS Code. Click "Authorize" and follow the prompts. You might
need to enter your GitHub password.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Come back to VS Code</strong> -- once you authorize, VS
Code will show your GitHub username in the bottom-left corner (click the
little person icon to check). If you see your username, you're signed
in.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What just happened?</strong> VS Code now has permission to
talk to GitHub as you. It can read your issues, your pull requests, your
notifications -- everything the agents need to help you.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-3-open-this-workspace">Step 3: Open This Workspace</h2>
<p>The agents are special files that live inside this project. VS Code
discovers them automatically -- but only if you have the right folder
open.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Open this folder in VS Code</strong> -- go to File &gt;
Open Folder (or <code>Ctrl+K Ctrl+O</code>) and navigate to the folder
that contains the <code>.github</code> directory. That's the folder
you're in right now if you can see this file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check that the agents are loaded</strong> -- open Copilot
Chat by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code> (on Mac:
<code>Cmd+Shift+I</code>). In the chat input box, type <code>@</code> --
you should see a dropdown list that includes names like
<code>@daily-briefing</code>, <code>@issue-tracker</code>,
<code>@pr-review</code>. If you see those, the agents are
ready.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don't see the agents?</strong> Make sure you opened the
<em>folder</em> (not just a single file) that contains
<code>.github/agents/</code>. Try File &gt; Open Folder and pick the
right directory. If that doesn't work, try reloading VS Code: press
<code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code>, type "Developer: Reload Window", and press
Enter.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-4-say-hello">Step 4: Say Hello</h2>
<p>Let's try the simplest thing first. In the Copilot Chat window:</p>
<p><strong>Type this and press Enter:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker how many open issues do I have?</code></pre>
<p>Wait a few seconds. The agent will: 1. Check who you are on GitHub 2.
Search for your open issues 3. Come back with a count and a summary</p>
<p><strong>Did it work?</strong> If you see a number and maybe a table
of issues -- congratulations, everything is connected. The agent just
talked to GitHub for you.</p>
<p><strong>Did it say "no issues found"?</strong> That's fine too! It
means you don't have any open issues right now. The connection is
working.</p>
<p><strong>Did it ask you to sign in?</strong> Go back to <a
href="#step-2-sign-in-to-github">Step 2</a> and make sure you're
authenticated.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-5-your-first-briefing">Step 5: Your First Briefing</h2>
<p>Now let's do something magical. This is the moment where everything
clicks.</p>
<p><strong>Type this in Copilot Chat:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@daily-briefing morning briefing</code></pre>
<p><strong>Then wait about 30 seconds.</strong> Here's what's happening
behind the scenes:</p>
<p>The Daily Briefing agent is waking up and fanning out across your
GitHub world. It's checking: - Every issue assigned to you, mentioning
you, or created by you - Every pull request waiting for your review -
Every PR you authored and its CI status - Recent releases across your
repos - Active GitHub Discussions you're part of - Accessibility changes
in VS Code (if you track that) - Community reactions on everything</p>
<p>It's scoring all of these by urgency -- who's waiting on you, what's
deadline-bound, what the community cares about -- and assembling them
into a document.</p>
<p>When it finishes, it saves two files in your workspace: -
<strong><code>.github/reviews/briefings/briefing-{today's date}.md</code></strong>
-- a markdown file you can read and edit right here in VS Code -
<strong><code>.github/reviews/briefings/briefing-{today's date}.html</code></strong>
-- an HTML file you can open in a browser (with full screen reader
support)</p>
<p><strong>Open the markdown file.</strong> You'll see sections like: -
<strong>Needs Your Action</strong> -- things where someone is
specifically waiting on you - <strong>Monitor &amp; Follow Up</strong> --
things happening that you should know about - <strong>Recently
Completed</strong> -- your recent accomplishments -
<strong>Guidance</strong> -- the agent's suggestions for what to focus
on</p>
<p><strong>This is your daily dashboard.</strong> You can check off
items as you complete them throughout the day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feeling overwhelmed?</strong> Don't worry -- you don't need to
understand every section right away. The most important one is "Needs
Your Action" at the top. Start there. Everything else can wait.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-6-explore-one-issue">Step 6: Explore One Issue</h2>
<p>Let's go deeper. Pick an issue from your briefing (or any issue you
know about) and ask the agent to show you the details.</p>
<p><strong>Type something like:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker deep dive into owner/repo#42</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>owner/repo#42</code> with a real issue. For example, if
you have an issue number 42 in a repository called
<code>my-project</code> owned by <code>my-username</code>, you'd
type:</p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker deep dive into my-username/my-project#42</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not sure what to type?</strong> If you're inside a git
repository, you can just use the issue number:</p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker show me issue #42</code></pre>
<p>The agent is smart enough to figure out which repo you mean from the
folder you have open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The agent will pull the full issue: description, every comment,
reactions, linked pull requests, and any related discussions. It saves
this as a workspace document too -- a detailed file you can review
offline.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-7-try-a-slash-command">Step 7: Try a Slash Command</h2>
<p>Slash commands are shortcuts. Instead of typing a full sentence to an
agent, you type <code>/</code> followed by a command name, and the agent
knows exactly what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong></p>
<pre><code>/my-issues</code></pre>
<p>That's it. Just <code>/my-issues</code> and press Enter. The Issue
Tracker agent will search for all your open issues and show them sorted
by priority.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few more to try:</strong></p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 45%" />
<col style="width: 54%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type this</th>
<th>What happens</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>/my-prs</code></td>
<td>Shows your open pull requests with review status and CI health</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/triage</code></td>
<td>Creates a prioritized triage dashboard and saves it to your
workspace</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/notifications</code></td>
<td>Shows your unread GitHub notifications grouped by type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/ci-status</code></td>
<td>Shows CI/CD health across your repos -- any failing builds?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>See the <code>/</code> autocomplete?</strong> When you type
<code>/</code> in the chat input, VS Code shows you all available
commands in a dropdown. Browse through them -- there are 28 in total, and
you can explore them at your own pace.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-8-leave-a-comment-without-opening-github">Step 8: Leave a
Comment Without Opening GitHub</h2>
<p>This is where it gets really fun. You can reply to issues and pull
requests without ever opening your browser.</p>
<p><strong>Type something like:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker reply to owner/repo#42</code></pre>
<p>The agent will: 1. Show you the recent conversation on that issue 2.
Ask what you want to say 3. Draft a reply for you 4. Show you a preview
of exactly what will be posted 5. Ask you to confirm:
<strong>Post</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>, or
<strong>Cancel</strong></p>
<p>Nothing gets posted until you say "Post." You're always in
control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nervous about posting?</strong> Totally normal. The agents
<em>always</em> preview before posting. They'll show you exactly what
will appear on GitHub, and they'll wait for your explicit confirmation.
Think of it like a "Send" button on an email -- you get to review
first.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-9-react-to-something">Step 9: React to Something</h2>
<p>Reactions are the lightest-weight way to participate on GitHub -- a
thumbs up, a heart, a rocket. They take two seconds and they let people
know you've seen their work.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong></p>
<pre><code>/react thumbs up owner/repo#42</code></pre>
<p>Or in natural language:</p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker like issue #42</code></pre>
<p>The agent shows the current reactions, adds yours, and confirms.
That's it. Someone's morning just got a little brighter.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="step-10-make-it-yours">Step 10: Make It Yours</h2>
<p>Now that you've seen what the agents can do, you can customize how
they work for you.</p>
<p><strong>Open <code>.github/agents/preferences.md</code></strong> in
your editor. This file controls things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your default merge strategy</strong> -- squash, rebase, or
merge commit?</li>
<li><strong>Your team roster</strong> -- names, GitHub handles, expertise
areas, and timezones</li>
<li><strong>Saved searches</strong> -- name your favorite filters so you
can run them with one command</li>
<li><strong>Response templates</strong> -- pre-written replies for common
situations ("Thanks for reporting! Could you provide steps to
reproduce?")</li>
<li><strong>Notification preferences</strong> -- which repos matter most,
which ones to mute</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to change anything right now. The agents work fine
with their defaults. But when you're ready to make the system feel like
<em>yours</em>, this is where you go.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-to-do-tomorrow-morning">What to Do Tomorrow Morning</h2>
<p>Here's your new morning routine. It takes about 5 minutes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Open VS Code</strong> and Copilot Chat
(<code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>
<code>@daily-briefing morning briefing</code></li>
<li><strong>Open the briefing</strong> -- scan "Needs Your Action"
first</li>
<li><strong>Work through the top items:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Need to review a PR? Type
<code>@pr-review review owner/repo#123</code></li>
<li>Need to reply to an issue? Type
<code>/issue-reply owner/repo#42</code></li>
<li>Want to triage your backlog? Type <code>/triage</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Check things off</strong> in the briefing document as you
complete them</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. By the end of your first week, this will feel as natural
as checking email.</p>
