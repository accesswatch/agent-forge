<blockquote>
<p><strong>Welcome back. You're in the right place.</strong></p>
<p>If you followed the <a href="GETTING-STARTED.md">Getting Started
guide</a>, you already know the basics -- you've run a briefing, explored
an issue, tried a slash command, and maybe even left a comment without
opening your browser.</p>
<p>This guide goes deeper. Much deeper. But don't worry -- we'll take it
one section at a time, at whatever pace feels right. Think of this as a
reference you'll keep coming back to as you discover new things you want
to do.</p>
<p><strong>New here?</strong> Start with the <a
href="GETTING-STARTED.md">Getting Started guide</a> first. It'll walk
you through setup and your first few commands. Then come back here when
you're ready for more.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this">What Is This?</h2>
<p>Let's paint the picture.</p>
<p>Right now, when you want to know what's happening on GitHub, you open
a browser. You check your notifications. You click into an issue. You
read the comments. You switch to a PR. You look at the diff. You go back
to your notifications. You open another tab for CI results. Another for
the project board. Another for Dependabot alerts.</p>
<p>That's a lot of tabs. A lot of context-switching. A lot of mental
overhead just to figure out what to work on.</p>
<p><strong>These agents change all of that.</strong></p>
<p>They live right inside VS Code's Copilot Chat -- the same window where
you might ask Copilot to help you write code. You type a question in
plain English, and they go talk to GitHub for you. They come back with
organized, prioritized, thoughtful answers. And when they produce
something substantial -- a daily briefing, a code review, a triage
dashboard -- they save it as a real file in your workspace that you can
edit, annotate, and check off throughout the day.</p>
<p>Here's what they cover:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 64%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>What You Need</th>
<th>What the Agents Do for You</th>

<p>And here's the best part: <strong>there's nothing to install beyond
what you probably already have.</strong> If GitHub Copilot is working in
your VS Code, you're ready to go. No extra extensions, no CLI tools, no
API keys.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="whats-new">What's New</h2>
<h3 id="v3-your-editor-just-became-your-github-command-center">v3: Your
Editor Just Became Your GitHub Command Center</h3>
<p>If you've been using an earlier version of these agents, here's
everything that's new. If you're just getting started, don't worry about
this section -- it's all included in the guide ahead.</p>
<p><strong>A whole new agent: Analytics &amp; Insights</strong> - Team
velocity, review turnaround times, issue resolution metrics - See who's
overloaded, which PRs are stuck, and which files keep changing -
Personal stats with team comparison -- see how your week stacks up - New
commands: <code>/team-dashboard</code> and <code>/my-stats</code></p>
<p><strong>Workspace Preferences -- teach the agents about your
team</strong> - A single file
(<code>.github/agents/preferences.md</code>) that every agent reads -
Set your merge strategy, default reviewers, response templates, saved
searches - Add your team roster with expertise areas and timezones -
Configure notification priorities -- what to surface, what to mute</p>
<p><strong>Release management from start to finish</strong> -
<code>/draft-release</code> builds release notes automatically from
merged PRs - <code>/release-prep</code> walks you through the entire
release preparation checklist</p>
<p><strong>CI/CD health is now built into everything</strong> - Your
daily briefing shows failing workflows and flaky tests - PR reviews show
which checks passed and which failed - <code>/ci-status</code> gives you
a quick health dashboard across repos</p>
<p><strong>Security monitoring across all your repos</strong> - Daily
briefings now include Dependabot alerts and security advisories - PR
reviews flag changes to security-sensitive files -
<code>/security-dashboard</code> gives you the full picture in one
view</p>
<p><strong>Multi-step workflow guides</strong> -
<code>/release-prep</code> -- complete release preparation, step by step
- <code>/sprint-review</code> -- end-of-sprint summary with velocity and
retrospective prompts - <code>/onboard-repo</code> -- first-time scan of
a new repository - <code>/pr-author-checklist</code> -- self-review
before you request reviews</p>
<p><strong>Notification management</strong> -
<code>/notifications</code> lets you list, filter, mark as read, and
unsubscribe -- all from the editor</p>
<p><strong>Branch management</strong> - <code>/manage-branches</code> --
list, compare, clean up stale branches, check protection rules</p>
<p><strong>Project board integration</strong> - Daily briefings now show
sprint progress from GitHub Projects - Issues show their project board
status - <code>/project-status</code> gives you a full board
overview</p>
<p><strong>Saved searches and response templates</strong> - Define named
searches once, use them everywhere:
<code>@issue-tracker search critical-bugs</code> - Pre-write replies for
common situations:
<code>@issue-tracker reply to #42 with template needs-info</code></p>
<h3 id="dual-output-markdown-html">Dual Output: Markdown + HTML</h3>
<p>Every workspace document the agents create comes in <strong>two
formats</strong>: - <strong><code>.md</code></strong> -- for editing in
VS Code, quick scanning, and checking off items -
<strong><code>.html</code></strong> -- optimized for screen readers,
browser viewing, and sharing with your team</p>
<p>The HTML versions aren't an afterthought. They have skip links, ARIA
landmarks, proper heading hierarchy, accessible tables, interactive
checklists, and automatic light/dark mode support.</p>
<h3 id="screen-reader-optimized-documents">Screen Reader Optimized
Documents</h3>
<p>All generated HTML follows strict accessibility patterns: - Skip link
as the first focusable element - Landmark roles for every section -
Descriptive link text (never bare URLs or "click here") - Tables with
captions, header scopes, and row headers - Status communicated through
text labels, not just emoji or color - Interactive checkboxes with
proper labels - <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> and
<code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media queries</p>
<h3 id="reactions-community-sentiment">Reactions &amp; Community
Sentiment</h3>
<p>Every issue and PR now includes reaction data -- thumbs up, hearts,
rockets, and more. Items with 5+ positive reactions are flagged as
community favorites, helping you prioritize what people actually care
about.</p>
<h3 id="release-awareness">Release Awareness</h3>
<p>PRs and issues now include release context -- which milestone they
belong to, which release they shipped in, and whether they're still
unreleased. Release-bound items get a priority boost in triage.</p>
<h3 id="github-discussions">GitHub Discussions</h3>
<p>Agents now monitor GitHub Discussions alongside issues and PRs --
discussions you're part of, discussions linked to your issues, and
high-activity threads that might need your attention.</p>
<h3 id="wcag-aria-cross-referencing">WCAG &amp; ARIA
Cross-Referencing</h3>
<p>The accessibility tracker now maps every fix to the specific WCAG
success criteria it addresses, identifies the ARIA design patterns
involved, and notes which assistive technologies benefit.</p>
<h3 id="full-github-interaction">Full GitHub Interaction</h3>
<p>You can now do everything from Copilot Chat -- PR comments (general,
single-line, multi-line, code suggestions), issue replies, reactions,
issue creation, PR merging, label management, and more. Nothing requires
opening a browser.</p>
<h3 id="configurable-accessibility-repos">Configurable Accessibility
Repos</h3>
<p>Track accessibility changes in any repo, not just VS Code. Point the
tracker at your own projects with custom label filters.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>
<p>If you want to see the whole system come alive in about two minutes,
here's how.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Open Copilot Chat</strong> -- press
<code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code> (or <code>Cmd+Shift+I</code> on Mac)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type this and press Enter:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@daily-briefing morning briefing</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Wait about 30 seconds.</strong> The agent is reaching out
across all your repos -- collecting issues, PRs, releases, CI status,
security alerts, discussions, and community reactions. It's scoring
everything by urgency and assembling it into a document.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open the file it created:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>.github/reviews/briefings/briefing-{today's date}.md</code> --
a markdown file you can edit right in VS Code</li>
<li><code>.github/reviews/briefings/briefing-{today's date}.html</code>
-- an HTML file you can open in your browser (with full screen reader
support)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. You now have a prioritized picture of your entire GitHub
world. The rest of this guide shows you everything else the agents can
do -- and there's a lot.</p>

<h2 id="the-agents">The Agents</h2>
<p>You have five agents, each with its own specialty. You talk to them
by typing <code>@agent-name</code> in Copilot Chat, followed by what you
need. They understand plain English -- no special syntax required.</p>
<p>Let's meet each one.</p>
<h3 id="daily-briefing">Daily Briefing</h3>
<p>Think of this agent as your morning assistant. You sit down, you ask
for a briefing, and it sweeps across every repo you're involved with. It
checks your issues, your PRs, recent releases, CI health, security
alerts, accessibility changes, GitHub Discussions, and community
reactions. Then it scores everything by urgency and builds you a single,
organized document.</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong> You know exactly what needs your
attention, what can wait, and what happened while you were away. No
clicking through tabs, no scrolling through notification emails.</p>
<p><strong>When to reach for it:</strong> - Start of your day -- "What
happened overnight?" - After a break -- "What changed since this
morning?" - End of the week -- "Give me a weekly summary"</p>
<p><strong>Here are some ways to talk to it:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@daily-briefing morning briefing
@daily-briefing what changed since this morning
@daily-briefing weekly report
@daily-briefing just PRs
@daily-briefing just issues for microsoft/vscode</code></pre>
<p><strong>What you get back:</strong> - A markdown file at
<code>.github/reviews/briefings/briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.md</code> - An HTML
file at <code>.github/reviews/briefings/briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.html</code>
- Sections for: Needs Action, Releases &amp; Deployments, Active
Discussions, Monitor, Accessibility Updates, Recently Completed,
Dashboard, and Guidance - Every item is priority-scored -- the most
urgent things appear first - Community reactions and sentiment are
included so you can see what people care about - Action items have
checkboxes you can tick off throughout the day - Run it again later and
it updates the same document with NEW markers instead of creating a
duplicate</p>

requests:</strong></p>

<h3 id="issue-tracker">Issue Tracker</h3>
<p>This is your go-to agent for anything issue-related. It doesn't just
list your issues -- it thinks about them. It scores them by urgency,
flags community favorites (the ones with lots of thumbs-up reactions),
links related PRs, surfaces discussions you might be missing, and checks
what's tied to upcoming releases.</p>
<p>But it also does things. You can reply to issues, create new ones,
close stale ones, add labels, assign people, set milestones, and even
batch-respond to questions -- all from the chat window.</p>
<p><strong>When to reach for it:</strong> - "What issues need my
attention?" - "Show me the full story on this specific issue" - "Help me
triage my backlog" - "Reply to this issue for me" - "Create a new bug
report" - "Close this as completed"</p>
<p><strong>Here are some ways to talk to it:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker show my open issues
@issue-tracker triage everything assigned to me
@issue-tracker deep dive into microsoft/vscode#12345
@issue-tracker reply to owner/repo#42
@issue-tracker reply to Alice&#39;s comment on #42
@issue-tracker create a bug report for login timeout in owner/repo
@issue-tracker thumbs up owner/repo#42
@issue-tracker close owner/repo#42 as completed
@issue-tracker add bug label to #42
@issue-tracker assign @alice to #42
@issue-tracker set milestone v2.0 on #42
@issue-tracker transfer #42 to owner/other-repo</code></pre>
<p><strong>Everything it can do:</strong> - <strong>Smart
search</strong> that understands natural language dates ("last week",
"since Monday") - <strong>Priority scoring</strong> that weighs
reactions, release deadlines, and discussion activity -
<strong>Auto-recovery</strong> -- if a search returns nothing, it
automatically broadens and tries again - <strong>Dual-format
documents</strong> for individual issues and triage dashboards -
<strong>Full comment system</strong> -- new comments, replies to specific
existing comments, batch replies - <strong>Issue creation</strong> with
smart templates for bugs, features, tasks, and questions -
<strong>Reactions</strong> -- add emoji reactions to issues and comments
using natural language - <strong>Issue management</strong> -- edit,
label, assign, close/reopen, lock/unlock, transfer, set milestones -
<strong>Saved searches</strong> -- define named filters in your
preferences and use them with one command - <strong>Response
templates</strong> -- pre-written replies for common situations, posted
with one command - <strong>Project board awareness</strong> -- shows
which column an issue is in on your project board - <strong>Community
pulse</strong> -- reactions and sentiment for every issue -
<strong>Release awareness</strong> -- flags issues tied to upcoming
releases - <strong>Discussion linking</strong> -- surfaces related GitHub
Discussions - <strong>Cross-referencing</strong> -- automatically finds
linked PRs, discussions, and mentions</p>

<h3 id="pr-review">PR Review</h3>
<p>This is your code review companion. When you point it at a pull
request, it pulls the complete picture: the full diff, every comment
thread, which CI checks passed or failed, whether any security-sensitive
files were changed, what release milestone the PR belongs to, and
community reactions.</p>
<p>Then it builds a structured review document with risk assessment,
before/after code snapshots, and a checklist you can work through
systematically. When you're ready, you can leave comments -- single-line,
multi-line, or even code suggestions that the PR author can apply with
one click. And when you're done reviewing, you can approve, request
changes, or merge -- all from chat.</p>
<p><strong>When to reach for it:</strong> - "Review this PR for me" -
"Show me PRs waiting for my review" - "Leave a comment on line 42" -
"Explain what this code does" - "Merge this PR"</p>
<p><strong>Here are some ways to talk to it:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@pr-review review microsoft/vscode#54321
@pr-review show PRs waiting for my review
@pr-review my open PRs -- which are ready to merge?
@pr-review comment on owner/repo#15
@pr-review comment on line 42 of auth.ts in PR #15
@pr-review comment on lines 40-60 of auth.ts in PR #15
@pr-review suggest a fix for line 42 of auth.ts in PR #15
@pr-review reply to @alice&#39;s comment on PR #15
@pr-review explain lines 40-60 in auth.ts on PR #15
@pr-review explain the handleAuth function in PR #15
@pr-review what changed in utils.ts in PR #15
@pr-review merge owner/repo#15
@pr-review request review from @alice on PR #15
@pr-review add bug label to PR #15
@pr-review thumbs up PR owner/repo#15
@pr-review approve owner/repo#15</code></pre>
<p><strong>Everything it can do:</strong> - <strong>Full asset pull in
one sweep</strong> -- metadata, diff, files, comments, commits, reactions
- <strong>File classification</strong> -- Feature / Bug Fix / Refactor /
Tests / Config / Docs - <strong>Risk assessment</strong> per file -- High
/ Medium / Low with explanations - <strong>Before/after
snapshots</strong> -- side-by-side code comparison for changed files -
<strong>Dual-format review documents</strong> with checklists you can
work through - <strong>Full commenting system</strong> -- general
comments, single-line, multi-line range, code suggestion blocks, reply
to threads, batch comments - <strong>Code understanding</strong> --
explain specific lines, functions, or file changes in plain language -
<strong>Reactions</strong> -- add emoji reactions to PRs and individual
comments - <strong>PR management</strong> -- merge (squash/rebase/merge
commit), edit title/description, labels, request/dismiss reviewers,
draft/ready toggle, close/reopen - <strong>CI check results</strong> --
which checks passed, which failed, with links to logs - <strong>Security
awareness</strong> -- flags when auth, crypto, or permissions files are
modified - <strong>Release context</strong> -- knows if the PR is
release-bound and adjusts advice accordingly - <strong>Accessibility
checklist</strong> -- dedicated section for UI change reviews -
<strong>Community sentiment</strong> -- reactions on the PR and on
individual comments</p>
<p><strong>What's in a review document:</strong> - Overview table with
PR metadata, reactions, and release context - Changed files summary with
risk levels - File-by-file analysis with before/after code, diffs, and
collapsible sections - Developer discussion thread with reactions -
Related GitHub Discussions - Commit story (chronological commit
messages) - Review checklist (correctness, security, performance,
architecture, testing, docs, accessibility) - Verdict and
recommendations with release context and community sentiment - A "My
Notes" section for your own annotations</p>

<h3 id="analytics-insights">Analytics &amp; Insights</h3>
<p>This agent is about understanding your team's patterns. Not in a
surveillance way -- in a "let's make sure nobody's drowning and our
process is healthy" way.</p>
<p>It tracks things like how long PRs sit before someone reviews them,
who's carrying the heaviest review load, which files keep changing (and
might need a refactor), and whether your team's velocity is trending up
or down. When it spots something off -- a teammate with 8 open review
requests, a PR that's been waiting 12 days -- it names it and suggests
what to do about it.</p>
<p><strong>When to reach for it:</strong> - "How's the team doing this
sprint?" - "What's my review turnaround time?" - "Who's overloaded right
now?" - "Which files change the most?"</p>
<p><strong>Here are some ways to talk to it:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@analytics team dashboard
@analytics my stats this month
@analytics review turnaround for owner/repo
@analytics bottlenecks
@analytics code hotspots in owner/repo
@analytics velocity last 4 weeks</code></pre>
<p><strong>What it tracks:</strong> - <strong>Review turnaround</strong>
-- time from PR open to first review, to approval, to merge -
<strong>Issue resolution</strong> -- time to close, comments before
resolution, reopen rates - <strong>Contribution activity</strong> -- PRs
authored/reviewed, issues closed per person - <strong>Team
velocity</strong> -- throughput trends, WIP counts, cycle time,
period-over-period comparison - <strong>Bottleneck detection</strong> --
stuck PRs, overloaded reviewers, unresponded issues - <strong>Code
churn</strong> -- hotspot files, change coupling, frequently modified
areas - <strong>Health scores</strong> -- composite 0-100 scores for
review health, issue health, velocity, and team balance - <strong>Load
balancing</strong> -- reviewer capacity recommendations based on your
team roster - <strong>Anomaly detection</strong> -- flags unusual spikes

<h3 id="vs-code-accessibility-tracker">VS Code Accessibility
Tracker</h3>
<p>This agent monitors accessibility changes across VS Code (both
Insiders and Stable builds) and any other repositories you point it at.
But it goes beyond just listing closed issues.</p>
<p>For every accessibility fix, it identifies the specific WCAG success
criteria being addressed, the ARIA design patterns involved, the impact
level, and which assistive technologies benefit. Monthly reports give
you a landscape view of what's improving and what still needs work.</p>
<p><strong>When to reach for it:</strong> - "What accessibility changes
shipped this week?" - "Screen reader improvements in February" - "Give
me a full accessibility report for this month" - "Track accessibility in
my own repo" - "What WCAG criteria were addressed this month?"</p>
<p><strong>Here are some ways to talk to it:</strong></p>
<pre><code>@insiders-a11y-tracker what&#39;s new in accessibility
@insiders-a11y-tracker screen reader changes this month
@insiders-a11y-tracker track a11y in my-org/my-repo
@insiders-a11y-tracker WCAG coverage this month
@insiders-a11y-tracker has minimap accessibility been fixed</code></pre>

<p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> - <strong>Configurable
repos</strong> -- track any repository, not just VS Code - <strong>WCAG
cross-referencing</strong> -- every fix mapped to specific success
criteria with conformance level - <strong>ARIA pattern mapping</strong>
-- identifies which WAI-ARIA design patterns are involved -
<strong>Impact assessment</strong> -- Critical / Major / Minor impact
levels - <strong>Assistive tech listing</strong> -- which screen readers
and assistive technologies are affected - <strong>WCAG coverage
analysis</strong> -- shows which principles got the most attention this
month - <strong>Trends and gaps</strong> -- identifies areas that still
need accessibility work</p>
<p><strong>Documents it creates:</strong> Dual-format monthly reports at
<code>.github/reviews/accessibility/a11y-report-YYYY-MM.md</code> and
<code>.html</code> with categorized changes, WCAG coverage tables, ARIA
pattern summaries, trend analysis, and useful links.</p>

<h2 id="workspace-preferences">Workspace Preferences</h2>
<p>Here's something that makes the whole system feel personal: a single
configuration file that every agent reads.</p>
<p>Edit <code>.github/agents/preferences.md</code> and the agents learn
about your team -- who reviews what, how you prefer to merge, what labels
matter, which repos to watch closely, and when your working day starts.
You set it up once, and every agent inherits that knowledge from then
on.</p>

<p><strong>How to get started:</strong> 1. Open
<code>.github/agents/preferences.md</code> in your editor 2. You'll see
sections with YAML code blocks and example values 3. Customize the
values that matter to your team -- you don't have to fill everything in
4. The agents read this file at the start of each session, so changes
take effect next time you talk to them</p>
<p><strong>Two features worth highlighting:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saved Searches</strong> let you define named filters and use
them by name:</p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker search critical-bugs
@issue-tracker search my-stale-prs
@issue-tracker search needs-triage</code></pre>
<p><strong>Response Templates</strong> let you pre-write replies for
common situations and post them with one command:</p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker reply to #42 with template needs-info
@issue-tracker reply to #42 with template duplicate ref:#30
@issue-tracker reply to #42 with template stale-closing</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don't feel pressured to set this up right away.</strong> The
agents work perfectly fine with their defaults. When you're ready to
customize -- maybe after a week of use, when you notice patterns -- come
back to this section.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-prompt-commands">The Prompt Commands</h2>
<p>Prompt commands are shortcuts. Instead of typing a full sentence to
an agent, you type <code>/</code> followed by a command name, and the
right agent fires up with the right tools already loaded.</p>
<p><strong>To use one:</strong> Open Copilot Chat, type <code>/</code>,
and you'll see all available commands in a dropdown. Pick one, add any
extra details (like a repo name or issue number), and press Enter.</p>

committed. No back-and-forth needed.</p>
<h3 id="code-understanding">Code Understanding</h3>

<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>

<p><strong>How merging works</strong> (the <code>/merge-pr</code> flow):
1. The agent checks readiness -- approvals, CI status, merge conflicts,
branch protection 2. If something is blocking the merge, it tells you
exactly what and offers to help 3. If everything is green, it shows your
merge strategy options: Squash and merge, Create merge commit, or Rebase
and merge 4. It shows the merge commit message and lets you customize it
5. You confirm (this is the point of no return) 6. After merging, it
offers to delete the source branch, close linked issues, and update your
briefing</p>

<h2 id="daily-workflows">Daily Workflows</h2>
<p>Now let's put it all together. These are repeatable routines --
sequences of commands that flow naturally into each other. After a few
days, they'll feel like second nature.</p>
<h3 id="morning-routine">Morning Routine</h3>
<p><strong>What you're doing:</strong> Going from "I just sat down" to
"I know exactly what to focus on today."</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> About 5-10 minutes.</p>
<pre><code>Step 1: Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I)
Step 2: Type: @daily-briefing morning briefing
Step 3: Wait about 30 seconds for the briefing to generate
Step 4: Open the briefing file:
        - .github/reviews/briefings/briefing-{date}.md (in VS Code)
        - .github/reviews/briefings/briefing-{date}.html (in your browser)
Step 5: Read the &quot;Needs Action&quot; section -- these are your top priorities
Step 6: Check &quot;Releases &amp; Discussions&quot; for anything time-sensitive
Step 7: Check things off throughout the day as you complete them</code></pre>
<p><strong>What typically comes next:</strong> - See a PR that needs
your review? --> <code>@pr-review review owner/repo#123</code> - See an
issue where someone's waiting on you? -->
<code>/issue-reply owner/repo#42</code> - See a release approaching? -->
Prioritize the release-bound items first - Want a deeper look at your
backlog? --> <code>/triage</code></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="pr-review-flow">PR Review Flow</h3>
<p><strong>What you're doing:</strong> A thorough, structured code
review -- the kind that catches real issues and respects the author's
work.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> About 10-20 minutes, depending on the PR
size.</p>
<pre><code>Step 1:  /review-pr owner/repo#123
Step 2:  Open the review document (.md or .html)
Step 3:  Check the release context -- is this tied to an upcoming release?
Step 4:  Work through the checklist, checking off items as you verify them
Step 5:  Need to understand something? /explain-code lines 40-60 in auth.ts on PR #123
Step 6:  Add your notes in the &quot;My Notes&quot; section
Step 7:  Leave comments: /pr-comment owner/repo#123
         - Single-line: &quot;comment on line 42 of auth.ts&quot;
         - Range: &quot;comment on lines 40-60 of auth.ts&quot;
         - Suggestion: &quot;suggest a fix for line 42&quot;
Step 8:  Reply to existing threads: @pr-review reply to @alice&#39;s comment on PR #123
Step 9:  Submit your review: @pr-review approve owner/repo#123
Step 10: Ready to merge? /merge-pr owner/repo#123</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="issue-triage-flow">Issue Triage Flow</h3>
<p><strong>What you're doing:</strong> Taking control of your backlog
instead of letting it pile up.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> About 10-15 minutes.</p>
<pre><code>Step 1:  /triage
Step 2:  Open the triage document (markdown or HTML)
Step 3:  Look at community reactions -- popular issues might deserve a priority bump
Step 4:  Check release context -- release-bound issues have real deadlines
Step 5:  For each issue, decide: Reply / Close / Reassign / Defer
Step 6:  Check boxes in the document as you make decisions
Step 7:  Reply: /issue-reply owner/repo#42
Step 8:  Refine: /refine-issue owner/repo#42
Step 9:  Close: /manage-issue close owner/repo#42 as completed
Step 10: Reassign: /manage-issue assign @alice to #42
Step 11: Show some appreciation: /react thumbs up owner/repo#42
Step 12: Need a new issue? /create-issue feature: add dark mode in owner/repo</code></pre>

<h2 id="workspace-documents">Workspace Documents</h2>
<p>Everything the agents produce -- briefings, reviews, triage
dashboards, analytics reports -- gets saved as real files in your
workspace. Not just chat messages that scroll away, but files you can
edit, annotate, commit, and share.</p>
<h3 id="dual-format-markdown-html">Dual Format: Markdown + HTML</h3>
<p>Every document comes in two formats:</p>

<p><strong>When to use markdown:</strong> - Editing and previewing in VS
Code (<code>Ctrl+Shift+V</code> for markdown preview) - Quick scanning
with familiar formatting - Checking off items by changing
<code>- [ ]</code> to <code>- [x]</code> - Committing to your repo</p>
<p><strong>When to use HTML:</strong> - Screen reader navigation --
landmarks, skip links, and proper heading hierarchy - Browser viewing
with automatic light/dark mode - Interactive checkboxes (just click
them) - Sharing with teammates who don't have VS Code open - Printing
with proper formatting</p>
<h3 id="screen-reader-accessibility">Screen Reader Accessibility</h3>
<p>The HTML documents aren't a token gesture. They're built
screen-reader-first, and they follow strict standards throughout.</p>

<p>The markdown documents are thoughtful too: - Item counts in section
headings (e.g., "## Needs Action (3 items)") - Text labels alongside
emoji - Collapsible <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> blocks for long content
- Descriptive link text throughout</p>
<h3 id="working-with-your-documents">Working with Your Documents</h3>
<p>These documents are meant to be lived in throughout the day. Here's
how to get the most from them:</p>
<p><strong>Check things off as you go.</strong> In markdown, change
<code>- [ ]</code> to <code>- [x]</code>. In HTML, click the checkbox.
By end of day, your briefing becomes a record of everything you
accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>Take notes.</strong> Every document ends with a "My Notes"
section -- a comment block in markdown, a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>
in HTML. Use it for decisions, blockers, questions, or anything else you
want to remember.</p>
<p><strong>They update, not duplicate.</strong> Run the same agent for
the same item again and it detects the existing document and adds to it
-- timestamped, with NEW badges -- instead of creating a second copy.</p>
<p><strong>Share them however works for your team.</strong> Both formats
are plain files: - Commit them so your team can see your review notes -
Add <code>.github/reviews/</code> to <code>.gitignore</code> to keep
them private - Drop the HTML file on a shared drive for browser
viewing</p>
<h3 id="gitignore-recommendation">Gitignore Recommendation</h3>
<p>If you'd prefer to keep review documents private (most people do),
add this to your <code>.gitignore</code>:</p>
<pre><code># GitHub agent review documents (personal workspace)
.github/reviews/</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2 id="enhanced-activity-signals">Enhanced Activity Signals</h2>
<p>The agents don't just fetch raw data from GitHub -- they layer on
context that helps you understand what matters. Every item comes
annotated with signals about urgency, community interest, staleness, and
more.</p>
<h3 id="reactions-community-sentiment-1">Reactions &amp; Community
Sentiment</h3>
<p>When an issue has 15 thumbs-up reactions, that's not vanity -- it's a
prioritization signal. The agents track reactions on everything:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 60%" />
<col style="width: 40%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>What the Agent Shows</th>
<th>What It Means</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Popular</strong></td>
<td>5+ positive reactions -- the community cares about this one</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Controversial</strong></td>
<td>Mixed positive and negative reactions -- might need extra
discussion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Quiet</strong></td>
<td>0-1 reactions -- standard priority</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You'll see reactions: - In issue and PR tables as a "Reactions"
column - On individual comments in deep dives - In HTML documents as
styled <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements with <code>aria-label</code>
descriptions - In the daily briefing's "Community Pulse" section</p>
<h3 id="release-awareness-1">Release Awareness</h3>
<p>The agents track releases across your active repos and annotate
everything with release context:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 36%" />
<col style="width: 63%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Signal</th>
<th>What It Means</th>

<td>This item is in the milestone for the next scheduled release</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Released</strong></td>
<td>This fix or feature already shipped in a specific version</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Unreleased</strong></td>
<td>Merged but not yet included in any release</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You'll see release context: - In PR reviews -- "This PR targets the
v2.0 release milestone (deadline: Feb 20)" - In triage dashboards --
release-bound issues get a priority boost - In daily briefings -- a
dedicated "Releases &amp; Deployments" section - In the address-comments
workflow -- helping you distinguish blocking from deferrable feedback</p>
<h3 id="github-discussions-1">GitHub Discussions</h3>
<p>The agents monitor GitHub Discussions alongside issues and PRs:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 44%" />
<col style="width: 55%" />

<h3 id="cicd-awareness">CI/CD Awareness</h3>
<p>The agents surface GitHub Actions workflow status so you don't have

which workflows to watch, flaky test thresholds, and how long is too
long for a job.</p>
<h3 id="security-dependencies">Security &amp; Dependencies</h3>
<p>The agents keep an eye on security-related activity across your
repos:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>

<h3 id="project-boards">Project Boards</h3>
<p>The agents integrate with GitHub Projects to show your sprint and
board context:</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="wcag-aria-cross-referencing-1">WCAG &amp; ARIA
Cross-Referencing</h2>
<p>The accessibility tracker doesn't just tell you what changed -- it
tells you <em>why it matters</em> and <em>who it helps</em>.</p>
<h3 id="wcag-coverage">WCAG Coverage</h3>
<p>Every accessibility fix is mapped to the specific WCAG 2.1/2.2
success criteria it addresses: - <strong>Principle</strong> --
Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, or Robust -
<strong>Criterion</strong> -- the specific success criterion number and
name - <strong>Level</strong> -- A, AA, or AAA conformance level -
Monthly reports include a "WCAG Coverage" section showing which criteria
got attention</p>
<h3 id="aria-design-patterns">ARIA Design Patterns</h3>
<p>When a fix involves ARIA, the tracker identifies the relevant
WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices pattern: - Pattern name (e.g., Dialog,
Combobox, Tree) - Key requirements of the pattern - Monthly reports
include an "ARIA Patterns Improved" summary</p>
<h3 id="impact-assessment">Impact Assessment</h3>
<p>Each fix includes: - <strong>Impact level</strong> -- Critical (blocks
access entirely), Major (significantly degrades the experience), Minor
(an inconvenience) - <strong>Assistive technologies affected</strong> --
NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack, and others</p>
<h3 id="configurable-repos">Configurable Repos</h3>
<p>You can track accessibility in any repository:</p>
<pre><code>@insiders-a11y-tracker track a11y in my-org/my-repo
@insiders-a11y-tracker track a11y in my-org/my-repo with label:a11y</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2 id="agent-handoffs">Agent Handoffs</h2>
<p>One of the nicest things about this system is that the agents talk to
each other. When one agent finishes its work, it offers to hand you off
to another agent that might be helpful next -- with full context carried
over.</p>
<p>For example: you finish reviewing a PR, and the agent offers to check
its linked issues. Or you triage an issue, and it offers to review the
PR that fixes it. Or your morning briefing highlights a priority item,
and it offers to deep dive into it.</p>
<p>These handoffs appear as clickable buttons below the agent's response
in chat. One click and you're in the next agent's hands.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-agents-connect">How the Agents Connect</h3>
<pre><code>Daily Briefing
+-- --> Issue Tracker (deep dive, reply, create, manage issues)
+-- --> PR Review (review, comment, explain, merge PRs)

<hr />
<h2 id="tips-tricks">Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
<p>Here are some things that will make the agents feel even more natural
to use. You'll discover your own favorites over time -- these are just a
starting point.</p>
<h3 id="talk-like-a-human">1. Talk Like a Human</h3>
<p>You don't need exact syntax. The agents understand what you mean: -
"Show me my stuff" --> lists your issues - "What PRs are waiting for me" -->
lists PRs needing your review - "Anything urgent?" --> prioritized list of
action items - "What's popular?" --> items with high community reactions -
"Release status" --> PRs and issues tied to upcoming releases</p>
<h3 id="you-probably-dont-need-to-type-the-repo-name">2. You Probably
Don't Need to Type the Repo Name</h3>
<p>If you're in a workspace with a git repo, the agents already know
which repo you mean. Just ask <code>@issue-tracker show my issues</code>
-- no need for <code>owner/repo</code>.</p>
<h3 id="dates-are-flexible">3. Dates Are Flexible</h3>
<p>"Last week", "since Monday", "this month", "between Jan 1 and Feb 15"
-- the agents understand all of these. No special date format
required.</p>
<h3 id="the-html-files-are-worth-opening">4. The HTML Files Are Worth
Opening</h3>
<p>Especially if you use a screen reader, but honestly for anyone. They
have skip links, landmark navigation, proper heading hierarchy,
accessible tables, and interactive checklists. Navigate by heading and
every section is one keypress away.</p>
<h3 id="track-accessibility-in-any-repo">5. Track Accessibility in Any
Repo</h3>
<p>Not just VS Code:</p>
<pre><code>@insiders-a11y-tracker track a11y in my-org/my-repo with label:accessible</code></pre>
<h3 id="release-aware-reviews-save-time">6. Release-Aware Reviews Save
Time</h3>
<p>When a PR is tied to a release milestone, the review document
separates "this blocks the release" from "nice to have." That way you
don't hold up a ship date debating variable names.</p>
<h3 id="community-reactions-are-prioritization-data">7. Community
Reactions Are Prioritization Data</h3>
<p>Five thumbs-up on a feature request means real people want it. The
agents surface this so you can make informed decisions about what to
work on next.</p>
<h3 id="run-briefings-more-than-once-a-day">8. Run Briefings More Than
Once a Day</h3>
<p>The daily briefing isn't limited to once per day. Run it again at 2pm
and it <em>updates</em> the existing document -- marking new items with
NEW badges instead of creating a duplicate.</p>
<h3 id="bulk-operations-work">9. Bulk Operations Work</h3>
<p>The agents handle batch requests gracefully: - "Reply to all issues
where someone asked me a question" - "Review all PRs waiting for me,
smallest first" - "Close all my stale issues labeled 'wontfix'"</p>
<h3 id="code-suggestions-are-powerful">10. Code Suggestions Are
Powerful</h3>
<pre><code>@pr-review suggest a fix for line 42 of auth.ts in PR #15</code></pre>
<p>The PR author gets an "Apply suggestion" button. One click and your
fix is committed. No back-and-forth, no "I made the change, please
re-review."</p>
<h3 id="understand-before-you-critique">11. Understand Before You
Critique</h3>
<p>Use <code>/explain-code</code> before <code>/pr-comment</code>. First
understand what the code does and why it's there. Then your comment has
context, and the author knows you read their work thoughtfully.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-reaction-goes-a-long-way">12. A Quick Reaction Goes a
Long Way</h3>
<p><code>/react</code> takes two seconds. A rocket on someone's merged
PR. A heart on a thoughtful comment. It costs you nothing and it means
something to the person who receives it.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-preferences-once-benefit-forever">13. Set Up Preferences
Once, Benefit Forever</h3>
<p>Edit <code>preferences.md</code> once. Every agent inherits your
merge strategy, reviewer mapping, saved searches, response templates,
team roster, and notification preferences. It compounds over time.</p>
<h3 id="name-your-searches">14. Name Your Searches</h3>
<p>Define filters once in preferences, use them anywhere:</p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker search critical-bugs
@issue-tracker search needs-triage</code></pre>
<h3 id="response-templates-kill-repetition">15. Response Templates Kill
Repetition</h3>
<p>Instead of typing "Thanks for reporting! Could you provide steps to
reproduce..." for the hundredth time:</p>
<pre><code>@issue-tracker reply to #42 with template needs-info</code></pre>
<p>Consistent, professional, and done in seconds.</p>
<h3 id="youll-know-when-ci-breaks">16. You'll Know When CI Breaks</h3>
<p><code>/ci-status</code> gives you the picture across all repos. Or
just let the daily briefing tell you -- failing workflows show up
automatically in the CI/CD Health section.</p>
<h3 id="security-monitoring-is-built-in">17. Security Monitoring Is
Built In</h3>
<p><code>/security-dashboard</code> pulls every Dependabot alert, every
advisory, every pending dependency update into one view. Across all your
repos. No more visiting each repo's security tab individually.</p>
<h3 id="sprint-reviews-write-themselves">18. Sprint Reviews Write
Themselves</h3>
<p><code>/sprint-review</code> generates a complete summary with
velocity metrics, carryover analysis, and retrospective prompts. Walk
into your team standup prepared.</p>
<h3 id="onboard-to-new-repos-in-minutes">19. Onboard to New Repos in
Minutes</h3>
<p>Joining a new project? <code>/onboard-repo owner/repo</code> scans
everything -- issues, PRs, releases, CI health, CODEOWNERS, security
alerts -- and tells you what needs attention first.</p>
<h3 id="self-review-before-requesting-reviews">20. Self-Review Before
Requesting Reviews</h3>
<p><code>/pr-author-checklist</code> catches the things that would
embarrass you -- leftover debug logging, missing tests, a vague PR title,
hardcoded secrets. Run it before anyone else sees your PR.</p>
<h3 id="ask-about-specific-wcag-criteria">21. Ask About Specific WCAG
Criteria</h3>
<pre><code>@insiders-a11y-tracker what fixes addressed WCAG 2.4.3 this month
@insiders-a11y-tracker keyboard navigation improvements</code></pre>

<h3 id="i-dont-see-the-agents-in-chat-autocomplete">"I don't see the
agents in chat autocomplete"</h3>
<p><strong>What's happening:</strong> The agents need to be in the
<code>.github/agents/</code> folder of your currently open workspace,
and VS Code needs to discover them.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> 1. Make sure you opened the
<em>folder</em> that contains <code>.github/agents/</code> -- not just a
single file 2. Check that the agent files end in <code>.agent.md</code>
3. Try reloading VS Code: <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> --> "Developer: Reload

<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> 1. Press <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> -->
type "GitHub: Sign In" 2. Follow the browser authentication flow 3. Come
back to VS Code and try again</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-agent-returns-0-results">"The agent returns 0 results"</h3>
<p><strong>What's happening:</strong> The search scope might be too
narrow, or you might not have any matching items right now.</p>
<p><strong>What agents do automatically:</strong> They broaden the
search and tell you what they tried.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to fix it manually:</strong> Be more explicit --
<code>@issue-tracker show all my open issues with no date filter</code></p>

<p><strong>What's happening:</strong> You've hit GitHub's API rate limit
(5,000 requests per hour).</p>
<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Wait a few minutes and try again. The
agent tells you when the rate limit resets.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-html-file-looks-broken">"The HTML file looks broken"</h3>
<p><strong>What's happening:</strong> It was probably opened in VS
Code's text editor instead of a browser.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Right-click the <code>.html</code>
file --> "Open with" --> your browser. Or use VS Code's built-in Simple
Browser (<code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> --> "Simple Browser: Open").</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="prompt-commands-dont-appear-when-i-type">"Prompt commands don't
appear when I type <code>/</code>"</h3>
<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> 1. Verify files exist in
<code>.github/prompts/</code> and end in <code>.prompt.md</code> 2.
Check that each file has valid YAML frontmatter 3. Reload VS Code:
<code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> --> "Developer: Reload Window"</p>
